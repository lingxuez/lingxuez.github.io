			I am a third year Ph.D. student in <a class="link" href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/">Department of Statistics</a> at <a class="link" href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. 
			Before coming to CMU, I earned my B.S. in Statistics and minor in Economics from <a class="link" href="http://www.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a>, China, in 2009. <br />

			My research mainly focuses on statistical genetics and high-dimensonal inference, under the supervision of Prof. <a class="link" href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~roeder/">Kathryn Roeder</a> and Prof. <a class="link" href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~jinglei/">Jing Lei</a>. Currently I am working on hypothesis testing problems on gene networks, with hope to understand more about the genetic architecture of Schizophrenia.
